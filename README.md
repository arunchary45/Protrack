# Real-Time Construction Monitoring System 🏗️📊

A machine-learning based system designed to monitor construction activity in real time, predict project progress, and provide data-driven insights through interactive dashboards. Built using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of construction activities using ML-driven predictions  
- Random Forest model achieving **95% detection accuracy**  
- Automated data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering  
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard for live progress visualization  
- Reduction of manual monitoring effort by **40%**  
- Faster decision-making through data-driven insights (**60% improvement**)

## 🔐 Safety & Security Monitoring

For safety compliance, the system integrates on-site sensors such as cameras to detect violations in real time.  
Using ML-based object detection, the model identifies:

- Workers not wearing **safety shoes**
- Missing **helmets**, **vests**, and other PPE equipment
- Unauthorized personnel entering restricted zones
- Unsafe behavior or potential risk scenarios

This automated detection enhances site safety by providing instant alerts and reducing manual supervision effort.
